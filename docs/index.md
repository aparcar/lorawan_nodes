# Start

This project evaluates the *LoRa* frequency modulation and the *LoRaWAN* stack
as an alternative for existing sensor setups using the technologies *ZigBee* and
*GSM*. The current scope is to build a simple stack to gather sensor data end
visualize them inside a web interface.

Within this work modular nodes were designed allowing to measure a variety of
environmental metrics, including temperature, rain fall, humidity and sea level.

Both software and hardware of nodes is documented as well as a low cost
monitoring setup as well as migration script to be compatible with existing
setups.

All work happened in collaboration with the *MESH LAB* at Oahu, Hawaii,
supervised by [Dr. Brian
Glazer](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/glazer/Brian_T._Glazer/CV.html)
and [Dr. Edo Biagioni](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~esb/).
