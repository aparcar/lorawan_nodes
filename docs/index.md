# Start

This project evaluates *LoRa* and *LoRaWAN* as an alternative for existing
sensor setups using the technologies *ZigBee* and *GSM*. The current scope is
to build a simple stack to gather sensor data end visualize is via an web
interface.

Within this work modular nodes were designed allowing to measure a variety of
environmental metrics, including temperature, rain fall, humidity and sea level.

Both software and hardware of nodes is documented as well as a low cost
monitoring setup as well as migration script to be compatible with existing
setups.

The evaluation tested both pure *LoRa* and the network stack *LoRaWAN*, while
both approaches worked, the latter was choses for future work as it massively
simplified the code requirements for the nodes.

All work happened in collaboration with the *MESH LAB* at Oahu, Hawaii,
supervised by [Dr. Brian
Glazer](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/glazer/Brian_T._Glazer/CV.html)
and [Dr. Edo Biagioni](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~esb/).

Please follow the menu entries on the left to find more information on the topics.

* **Software:** Documentation on created software or setup examples.
* **Hardware:** Collection of hardware used within this project. It may help
  the development to have such information in a single place instead of
  distributed over the multiple Vendor websites.
* **Datasheets:** Similar to the hardware section collection of used documents
  for evaluation.
