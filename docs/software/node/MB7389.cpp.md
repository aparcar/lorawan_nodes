# MB7389.cpp

This mini library reads serial distance measurements from a MB7389 ultrasonic
distance sensor. Within this project it is used to measure sea level and tides,
however it could be used for other purposes as well, for instance gasoline
levels of tanks.

The MB7389 sensor returns via serial connection 6 times a second the current
distance. A returned string stars with the upper case letter `R` and ends with a
carrier return `\r`, between are four digits containing the distance, i.e.
`R4301` would describe a distance of 4301 millimeters or 4.301 meters.

It is possible to provide the `get_sonic_distance()` function a `counter` value
which return the average of *N* measurements, for instance 60 to get the average
distance of a minute.

The *software serial* only requires the `RX` PIN since no data is ever send to
the distance sensor.
