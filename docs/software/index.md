# Overview

The Software section describes all code and tooling used and created within this
project. Below is a list of sub-sections describing the full setup in detail and
should be followed in that order.

It is recommended to read the [Hardware](../hardware) section first to have the
required sensor nodes for measurements and RaspberryPi or virtual machine to
store data.

1. Understanding and setting up [TheThingsNetwork and
   LoRaWAN](thethingsnetwork.md)
2. Setting up [Platformio](platformio.md) development framework
3. Setting up [sensor nodes](node/index.md) to collect measurements
4. Setting up [InfluxDB](influxdb.md) to store measurements
5. Setting up [Grafana](grafana.md) to visualize measurements
